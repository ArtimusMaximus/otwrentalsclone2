                Vacation homes for rent by owners
                A big advantage of renting directly from the property owner is that no one knows the property better than the person who owns it. Any questions you have concerning the property can be answered quickly by the owner as opposed to a management company that might have to contact the owner first to get the answer. Property owners can be a very valuable asset for making a good vacation a great one. The owner can provide you with more accurate information about the property than a property management company because the owner is obviously more familiar with the house.

                Many vacation rental property owners live in the area where they are renting. This can be a valuable resource because the owner can give you inside information about the area. The owner may be able to let you in on where the restaurant specials are or where to go for entertainment. They can also clue you in to the local laws and customs to help you feel less like a tourist.

                Most property management companies have set rates with no room for negotiating. Dealing directly with the owner offers much more flexibility because it eliminates the middle man. If you notice the owners reservation calendar mostly empty during the dates you plan on vacationing, you may be able to negotiate a discount. 

                Vacation rentals by owner properties can be offered at a cheap price compared to those run by a property management company because they are not sharing a percentage of their rental income. Full service property management companies can charge anywhere from 10 to 22 percent for service fees. Many companies also have hidden charges; reservation fees, cleaning and linen fees, credit check fees and so forth. By dealing directly with the owner you can bypass many of these charges. Talk with the owner about bringing your own linens and some amenities and save money. The owner may be more flexible regarding check-in and check-out times. Most property management companies are very strict about these times and many of them charge hefty penalties for late check-outs.
