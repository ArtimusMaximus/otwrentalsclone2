                Sunset Beach is the most northern portion of Huntington Beach and is a wonderful one-mile long   “small town”, with year around events, it is close to many Southern California attractions - but nestled away on a beautiful un-crowded white sandy beach. Its name gives away our secret of breath taking sunsets and views of Catalina Island from these dream homes.  Each home is approximately 6 miles from the Huntington Beach pier and just over 1 mile from the Seal Beach pier.

                Sunset Beach is a beautiful, cozy beachfront community.  It is located just northwest of Huntington Beach (Surf City) in Orange County, California. The two best features of Sunset beach is the fact that it is one of the widest beaches in southern California and the Green Belt that runs parallel to the beach from the northern edge of town to the southern edge of town.  The Sunset Beach Green belt is great for walking, exercising or just sitting and enjoying the amazing ocean view.   Since the beach is so wide and there are no beach vendors or buildings the sunset looks amazing.  Sunset Beach is truly one of California’s gems. Typical local entertainment includes romantic beach walks, swimming, surfing, surf-fishing, bicycle riding, sunbathing, reading, relaxing, great restaurants, and just about any other fun activity that one can dream up.
